This module will be taught synchronously through Zoom or through live in-place lecture at the LT (where allowed). 
This iteration will not be conducted in a flipped style, unlike previous iterations. Recordings of the class will be taken, 
and are likely (but not guaranteed) to be offered in the Conferencing component. 
Students are expected to be available for both lecture hours and their respective tutorial slots. 
Tutorials will involve a mix of activities; activities are likely to vary week to week.


Lecture and tutorial attendance is not mandatory, but will help with
your participation grade. Participation is very helpful for your
teaching staff too. Without it, we have very little idea whether you
understand the material that we’ve presented or whether it’s too
difficult or trivial. Giving feedback in the form of questions,
discussion provides us with a better idea of what topics you enjoy and
which you are not too keen on.

## Academic Honesty Policy

Please note that we enforce these policies vigorously. While we hate
wasting time with these problems, we have to be fair to everyone in
the class, and as such, you are advised to pay attention to these
rules and follow them strictly.

Collaboration is a very good thing. Students are encouraged to work
together and to teach each other. On the other hand, cheating is
considered a very serious offense. Please don’t do it! Concern about
cheating creates an unpleasant environment for everyone. You will be
automatically reported to the vice-dean of academic affairs if you are
caught, no exceptions will be made for any infractions no matter how
slight the offense.

So how do you draw the line between collaboration and cheating? Here’s
a reasonable set of ground-rules. Failure to understand and follow
these rules will constitute cheating, and will be dealt with as per
University guidelines. We will be enforcing the policy vigorously and
strictly.

You should already be familiar with the University’s honor code. If
you haven’t yet, read it now.

**The Pokémon Go Rule**: This rule says that you are free to meet with
fellow students(s) and discuss assignments with them. Writing on a
board or shared piece of paper is acceptable during the meeting;
however, you may not take any written (electronic or otherwise) record
away from the meeting. This applies when the assignment is supposed to
be an individual effort. After the meeting, engage in a half hour of
mind-numbing activity (like catching up with your friends and family’s
activities on Facebook, before starting to work on the
assignment. This will assure that you are able to reconstruct what you
learned from the meeting, by yourself, using your own brain.  The
Freedom of Information Rule: To assure that all collaboration is on
the level, you must always write the name(s) of your collaborators on
your assignment. Failure to adequately acknowledge your contributors
is at best a lapse of professional etiquette, and at worst it is
plagiarism. Plagiarism is a form of cheating.

**The No-Sponge Rule**: In intra-team collaboration where the team,
as a whole, produces a single “product”, each member of the team must
actively contribute. Members of the team have the responsibility (1)
to not tolerate anyone who is putting forth no effort (being a sponge)
and (2) to not let anyone who is making a good faith effort “fall
through a crack” (to help weaker team members come up to speed so they
can contribute). We want to know about dysfunctional team situations
as early as possible. To encourage everyone to participate fully, we
make sure that every student is given an opportunity to explain and
justify their team’s approach.

This section on academic honesty is adapted from Surendar Chandra’s
course at the University of Georgia, who in turn acknowledges
Prof. Carla Ellis and Prof. Amin Vahdat at Duke University for his
policy formulation. The origin of the original rule, called the
Gilligan’s Island rule, is uncertain, but at least can be traced back
to Prof. Dymond at York University’s use of it in 1984.

## Late Submissions

All homework assignments are due by 23:59:59
(Singapore time; SGT) on the due date. No exceptions without a medical
certificate will be made. 

Late submissions are penalized as 5% off per day late, capped to a maximum deduction of 40% of the total marks.

## Assignment return policy and regrades

All students have a right to question the grading of their work. If a
regrade is sought for a particular milestone, this must be brought to
our attention within 3 days of the return of the preliminary grades by
email. Requests later than that will not be entertained without
certified medical leave or school permission.
